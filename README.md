# JavaScript Madness

## Description

Welcome to JavaScript Madness! Or, welcome to a 10 question quiz of basic JavaScript questions generated using JavaScript itself! This is a simple and interactive web application built using JavaScript. This app is designed to be user-friendly and customizable, making it suitable for educational purposes, trivia games, or knowledge assessments.

This is my first JavaScript project I coded from scratch. This project helped me grow my skills in navigating the DOM, using localStorage, and combining my knowledge of CSS, HTML and JavaScript. I'd be lying if I said this project was easy - but through hours of work, Googling, experimenting, and more, I'm happy to come out with an app I'm proud of.

## What comes next? and other issues...

Moving forward, I'm going to focus on specific areas such as DOM traversal, dynamically appending HTML to web pages using JavaScript, and optimizing the efficiency of my functions. DOM traversal is a fundamental skill in web development. By honing this skill, I aim to enhance my ability to interact with and modify web content dynamically. I'm also committed to making my JavaScript functions more streamlined and efficient. This involves refining my coding practices to write cleaner, more maintainable code that improves both functionality and performance, ultimately delivering a better user experience.

One of the bugs I noticed is with my timer - it seems the timer will go negative for a split second before ending the game (if time runs out, that is). I'd like to tighten some aspects up, but I know that will come with practice and dedication!

Another feature I'd like to add is a brief message that appears on the screen alerting the user whether or not their selection was correct or incorrect.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Simply read the instructions printed on the home page and then click the "Start" button to begin!

10 questions will be presented to you individually.

For every correct answer, you will gain 10 points.

For every incorrect answer, 10 seconds will be deducted from your score.

The game ends when you either answer all the questions or run out of time.

After the game ends, enter your initials in the input field and click Submit.

Your scores will be available to view on the leaderboard page!
